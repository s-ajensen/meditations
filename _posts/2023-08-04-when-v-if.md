title: "when v. if"
---

One of the great advantages that I've found using Clojure is the *extremely minimal* syntax required to generate extremely expressive statements. In this way, I like to think of Clojure as a *dense* language, where lots of meaning is packed into each function call. While this provides a great advantage to the developer *writing* code (as they simply have less code to write), it provides a smiliar advantage to the developer *reading* coe which has already been written because there is less code to scan.

When scanning such code, we find ourselves slipping into patterns of recognition to help us along. For instance, when I see a call to `map`, the first thing I do is look at the final argument because it tells me what each value the predicate being applied to is. Likewise, whenever I come across an `if` call, the first thing I do is look for is the negative case, so I can juxtapose it in my mind with the positive one.

While Clojure will certainly allow you to make a call to `if` with *only* the positive case, it defies the expectations of the developer reading it. It's for this reason that the `when` function is so useful. When scanning code with calls to `when`—as opposed to `if`—I know that I'm simply looking at a block which will execute some code given a predicate. Therefore, I *only* use `if` when I need to handle a negative predicate, and use `when` in the case that there is only a positive one.
