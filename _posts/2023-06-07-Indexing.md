title: "Indexing"
---

One of the most basic problems we often have to solve while programming is iterating through a sequence, performing some operation based on the index. In Java, this might look something like this:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    System.out.println(i + ") " arr[i]);
}
```

The above program takes each index and labels the data at that location like so:

```
0) first thing
1) second thing
...
```

But in Clojure, where we use iterators, maps, filters, etc., how can we accomplish the same thing? By far my favorite way to handle this case is to use the `map-indexed` funciton which—much like the normal `map` function—projects each value in a `seq` into a new one based on a function, but this function takes in two parameters: the index and the value. This allows us to do the following:

```clojure
(map-indexed (fn [idx itm] (str idx ") " itm)) my-seq)
```

to accomplish what we did above.
