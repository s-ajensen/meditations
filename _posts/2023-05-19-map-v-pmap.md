title: "map v. pmap"
---

By far one of the most widely-used functions in the Clojure-sphere is that of `map`. The concept is simple enough, it iterates over a collection of items and predicates some value of each of them, returning an analagous collection of the predicates.

But sometimes our collections are very large... and our predicates expensive. What are we to do in this case? 

This is where `pmap` comes to the rescue. 

On the surface, `pmap` seems to simply do the same as `map`:
```clojure
(map inc [1 2 3 4 5]) ; => (2 3 4 5 6)
(pmap inc [1 2 3 4 5]) ; => (2 3 4 5 6)
```

But underneath the surface, Clojure is spinning up threads for chunks of these items to run the map in parallel. In small cases such as these, the resultant performance will likely slower as the performance impact of spinning up threads is so much greater than that of performing the `inc` function. But in cases where a great deal of processing power is needed for each item, it can drastically increase performance as multiple cores are able to process the collection.
