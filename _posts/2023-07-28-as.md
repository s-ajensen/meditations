title: "as->"
---

By far one of my favorite features of the Clojure language is the threading operator (in both its forms). While I've extolled its virtues in previous posts, I was unaware (until recently) about its more general form `as->`, which has a very similar functionality.

While the thread before (`->`) and thread after (`->>`) macros allow us to pass the evaluation of a function as the first or last values of another (respectively), the `at->` macro allows us to pass around the value we get agnostically like so:

```clojure
(as-> 0 n
  (inc n)
  (inc n))
```

This is a trivial case of its use, but demonstrates it nonetheless. We here treat `n` as `0` and pass it to `inc` as its first parameter. `n` is now treated as the result of this value and passed to the next call which increments it again to `2`.

This is particularly useful when used *within* other threading calls where we wish to use a threaded through value in a position other than the one which the original call dictates like so:

```clojure
(-> [w]
  (conj x)              ; conj expects the vec to be the first parameter
  (as-> y (cons w y)))  ; cons expects the vec to be the last parameter
```
