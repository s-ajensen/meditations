title: contains?
---

I find myself making a common mistake over and over again so I figured it was time I documented the correct solution to make it easier to refer back to in the future.

It is often the case that I want to check whether or not a given value is contained within a non-associative seq (e.g. a `list`). It is often tempting to use the familiar `contains?` func to acheive this, especially after using it so commonly for associative structures:

```clojure
; this works
(contains? {:a 1} :a) ;=> true

; this doesn't
(contains? '(1 2 3) 1) ;=> IllegalArgumentException
```

Why is this? As per the [official docs](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/contains_q) for `contains?`, the function

```
"Returns true if key is present in the given collection, otherwise
returns false."
```

In the first example above, we use a map—a keyed sequence—so `contains?` works as expected. But `list`s aren't associative, they're linked lists under the hood, so the notion of a "key" doesn't apply.

It's here that it's worth mentioning that a `vec`, being both a sequential and associative, is an acceptable target for `contains?`, but perhaps not in the way you would expect. The "keys" for a vector are its indicies, not its members, so while the following is true

```clojure
(contains? [:a :b :c] 2) ;=> true
```

this is not:

```clojure
(contains? [:a :b :c] :a) ;=> false
```

Returning to lists, then, what is the proper way to determine the presence of an item? While some have opted to employ the aid of helper functions such as

```clojure
(defn in? [coll itm]
  (some #(= itm %) coll))
```

I prefer the simpler

```clojure
(some #{1} '(1 2 3)) ;=> returns true
```

While this will fail to return the correct response for items evaluating to `false` or `nil` (whereas the helper does not), I still think it to be the quickest to the draw for the task at hand.
