title: "Bound by Threads"
---

In my last post, I briefly discussed vars in clojure as they pertain to tricking the compiler into reading private functions of another namespace. Here, I'd like to talk a bit more about what they are and how we use them.

`Var`s in clojure are, naturally, a mechanism to manage mutable state. Although we never explicitly name a keyword a `var`, they're used under the hood every time we call `def`:

```clojure
; unbound var
(def x) ; => #object[clojure.lang.Var@Unbound 0x...]
; bound var
(def y 10) ; => 10
```

Using `def` will, by default, not allow us to rebind these symbols, but when we use the `^:dynamic` meta tag, we can pass it around more like what we are used to in other languages with similar semantics:

```clojure
(def ^:dynamic x 1)

(inc x) ; => 2

(binding [x 5]
  (inc x)) ; => 6

(inc x) ; => 2
```

You will notice that when redefining `x` within the scope of the binding, the new value is localized to that particular scope. Now, you may wonder why we would not simply use `with-redefs` in this case and, indeed, we could have. However, `with-redefs` will alter the so-called 'root binding' of the var which means that the new value will be noticeable across multiple threads:

```clojure
(def ^:dynamic *x* 1) ; 'binding' requires a dynamic var (though with-redefs does not)

(binding [*x* 5]
  *x*) ; => 6
(with-redefs [*x* 5]
  *x*) ; => 6
```

As you can see, on the same thread the two functions do effectively the same thing, though `binding` requires a dynamic var.

```clojure
(binding [*x* 5]
  (doto (Thread. (fn [] *a*)) (.start) (.join))) ; => 1
(with-redefs [*x* 5]
  (doto (Thread. (fn [] *a*)) (.start) (.join))) ; => 5
```

Simply using `binding`, the thread that's created is still using the value of the root binding of `*x*`, 1, while the `with-redefs` version *rebound* this var to be 5.
